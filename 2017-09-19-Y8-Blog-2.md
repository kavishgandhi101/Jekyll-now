    <td>I knew how to set up a fuzebox already since I own a Raspberry Pi ,which is inside a fuzebox, so that was very easy. When we got onto our computer we started work straight away but the team next to us were having difficulties so I helped them . This shortened our time by a fair bit so we did not do much.</td>
