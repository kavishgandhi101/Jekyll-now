    <td>In this lesson I was working very hard and I managed to complete 4 more again meaning that I was working very quickly and sufficient. The effective strategies was to not actually talk to somebody and go off topic about it and I would be able to help them if they needed help and I would just go back to my own work once I'm finished with helping them. Also considering that last week I did very well in working with completing 3 stages, I managed to stay consistent this week.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think that nothing really limited my learning today because we got the full 60 minutes of working time today again and I didn't get distracted with anything in the whole lesson and also I could work on one habit which is just to stay consistent in weeks. As I have said in previous blogs, I work well one week but the next week I just let myself down. That is why next week I will hopefully be able to stay as hard-working and as consistent as possible once again.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I will improve my learning by helping other students a bit more as they ask me for help however I still sometimes put myself first before them which is a very selfish thing to do (in my opinion) and also for homework we had to complete the full 100% of python on codecademy which I have managed to do at home and now I am happy that I have finally completed all of python.</td>
