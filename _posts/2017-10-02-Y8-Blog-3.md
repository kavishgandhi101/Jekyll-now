    <td>Last lesson my partner was Cormac, but since most of the pairs were messing around and not doing any work, it meant that we all had to change. My new partners are Kayan and Matt. Both I know well, but do not do much with. I had lots of fun and did a lot, with kayans silly remarks about 'Dem Apples'.

    <td>I think we messed around quite a bit in the beginning because Matt's USB stick wouldnâ€™t work and insisted on using it, but we just used mine in the end. This took a long time to sort out so we didn't have long left of the lesson, but we did what we could.
