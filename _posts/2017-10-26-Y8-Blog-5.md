    <td>This week we were making pictures with the fuzebox software, like a pacman, or a love heart etc. We made our own pictures ad made them into a near game/roleplay. This was great fun and we thoroughly thought it through. (lots of 'Thou', I know.)

    <td>We need to not mess about and add silly things and focus on things that we have to remember. I think that we spent too long messing about with typing the code , and because Kayan is a slow typer we could have progressed more.Another important factor it that matt got all of the calculations wrong so we had to faff around with that.</td>
