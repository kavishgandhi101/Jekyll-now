Blog 5 - Improving our Blogs

In our last lesson as well as having to work on fuze box we had to look at our blogs and see where we could go forward with them. Here are my points and reasons:

1. Semi-transparent boxes     ----   Always a good idea to see the background  and the other aspects of the blog  page

2. Less busy backgrounds    ----  This means you can decide on a color scheme and you can see the writing.

3. Good size background    ----  If you cannot see the writing because your blank space on your background is getting in the way - get a bigger background.

4. Coloured background   ----  If your background is coloured but not transparent at least it shows that you have tried, because it is hard work figuring out which colour input is for what.

5. Avatar size   ---- If your avatar is too big it means that there is obviously something wrong with your code for the blog

I will definitely be looking out for these problems next term because it will be helpful to refer back to past mistake and hopefully not make the same mistakes again.
