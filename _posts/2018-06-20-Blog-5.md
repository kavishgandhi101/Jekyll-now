  <tr>
    <td>In this lesson I wasn't that hard working or focused as I was getting distracted much more easier, talking to my friends about other topics that we wouldnâ€™t have been talking about. Also I was talking to them and helping them but eventually we were off topic talking about something else. One effective strategy is that I did manage to complete 1 and a half stages from ignoring some friends who were trying to get my attention.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that nothing really limited my learning today because we got the full 60 minutes of working time today however me being pretty clever and good at this, I had to help some of the other boys if they were stuck meaning I lost some precious time. As I said earlier, the main habit I need to work on is that if I have one really good week like last time where I would really well, I just ruin that and I manage to have a less productive session the following week.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>For next time, I will improve my learning by helping other students however I do it quicker and try to get back to my own work because I am a kind of person who gets distracted very easily. Also I managed to talk quite a bit during silence time which really doesn't help my learning. So for next time I will change my working attitude and go in the lesson ready to learn and work hard.</td>
